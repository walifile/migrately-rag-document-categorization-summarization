## **Endpoints**

### 1. **POST** `/upload`
- **Description**: Handles multiple document uploads and processes them.
- **Flow**:
  1. Uploads documents to cloud storage and retrieves download links.
  2. Generates embedding vectors for the documents and descriptions.
  3. Queries the vector database to summarize document context.
  4. Passes the context to OpenAI GPT to generate:
     - A readable summary.
     - A category for the document.
  5. Stores metadata in MongoDB:
     - Document cloud link
     - Generated summary
     - Document category
     - Additional metadata

### 2. **GET** `/summaries`
- **Description**: Retrieves summaries grouped by category.
- **Flow**:
  1. Fetches summaries from MongoDB.
  2. Returns summaries organized by category.

---

### 3. **POST** `/case`
- **Description**: Prepares a comprehensive case statement for O-1 visa applications.
- **Flow**:
  1. Collects grouped summaries from the database.
  2. Generates a detailed case statement via OpenAI GPT.
  3. Stores the case statement in MongoDB for future use.

---

### 4. **GET** `/case/latest`
- **Description**: Retrieves the most recent case statement.
- **Flow**:
  1. Queries MongoDB for the latest case statement.
  2. Returns the details of the case.

---

### 5. **GET** `/case/latest/download`
- **Description**: Downloads the most recent case statement as a PDF.
- **Flow**:
  1. Fetches the latest case statement from MongoDB.
  2. Converts the statement to a PDF using FPDF.
  3. Returns the PDF file to the client.
